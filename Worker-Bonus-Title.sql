-- 游릭 Step 4: DQL Operations (with descriptions)
-- ------------------------------

-- 1. IN: Filter rows where first name is Monika or Sonika
SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE FIRST_NAME IN ('Monika', 'Sonika');

-- 2. NOT IN: Get workers not in HR or Finance departments
SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE DEPARTMENT NOT IN ('HR', 'Finance');

-- 3. BETWEEN: Get workers with salary between 55000 and 70000
SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 55000 AND 70000;

-- 4. IS NULL: Get workers where department is not assigned
SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE DEPARTMENT IS NULL;

-- 5. LIKE (Pattern Search):
-- First name starts with 'S'
SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE 'S%';

-- First name ends with 'a'
SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '%a';

-- First name contains 'it'
SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '%it%';

-- 6. ORDER BY: Sort workers by salary ascending
SELECT * FROM Worker ORDER BY SALARY ASC;

-- Sort workers by joining date descending
SELECT * FROM Worker ORDER BY JOINING_DATE DESC;

-- 7. DISTINCT: Show unique departments (ignores duplicates)
SELECT DISTINCT DEPARTMENT FROM Worker;

-- 8. GROUP BY: Total salary for each department
SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS Total_Salary
FROM Worker
WHERE DEPARTMENT IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;

-- 9. GROUP BY with HAVING: Show departments where total salary > 110000
SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS Total_Salary
FROM Worker
WHERE DEPARTMENT IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT
HAVING SUM(SALARY) > 110000;

-- 10. JOIN (Worker + Bonus): Show worker name with bonus amount
SELECT w.FIRST_NAME, b.BONUS_AMOUNT
FROM Worker w
JOIN Bonus b ON w.WORKER_ID = b.WORKER_REF_ID;

-- 11. JOIN (Worker + Title): Show worker name with title
SELECT w.FIRST_NAME, t.WORKER_TITLE
FROM Worker w
JOIN Title t ON w.WORKER_ID = t.WORKER_REF_ID;
